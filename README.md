# Automatic Nutrient Dosing System

Welcome to the Automatic Nutrient Dosing System project! This repository contains the code and documentation for an innovative system designed to optimize agricultural productivity by precisely managing nutrient levels in irrigation systems.

## Project Overview

The Automatic Nutrient Dosing System utilizes Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers along with integrated sensors to automate the dosing of nutrients, ensuring optimal growth conditions for crops. By maintaining precise nutrient levels, this system enhances crop yield, reduces maintenance time, and significantly boosts agricultural efficiency.

## Features

- **Integrated Sensors**: Continuous monitoring of temperature, electric conductivity (EC), and pH levels to maintain optimal nutrient conditions.
- **High Accuracy**: Reliable pH measurements with 98% accuracy, ensuring precise adjustments and optimal growing conditions.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Enhances crop yield by 25% and reduces maintenance time by 50% through automated nutrient management.
- **Dual Pump Integration**: Automated dosing with dual pumps for pH adjustment and nutrient solution delivery based on real-time sensor data.
- **Enhanced Crop Production**: Implements EC and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurements, contributing to a 75% increase in crop production.
